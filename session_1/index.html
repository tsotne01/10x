          Mars – the fourth planet from the Sun – is a dusty, cold, desert world
          with a very thin atmosphere. This dynamic planet has seasons, polar
          ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons and weather.

      <h2 style="color: crimson">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <mark
          >Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's
          the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.
          NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter
          and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago. Mars was
          named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was
          reminiscent of blood. The Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning
          "the red one." Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet"
          because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing
          the surface to look red.
        </mark>
      </p>
      <h2 style="color: blueviolet">Namesake</h2>

      <p>
        Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its
        reddish color was reminiscent of blood. Other civilizations also named
        the planet for this attribute – for example, the Egyptians called it
        "Her Desher," meaning "the red one." Even today, it is frequently called
        the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or
        rust, causing the surface to look red.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: green">Potential for Life</h2>
      <p>
        Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on
        Mars. Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long ago,
        when Mars was warmer and covered with water.
      </p>
      <h2 style="color: aqua">Size and Distance</h2>

      <p>
        With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the
        size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about
        as big as a raspberry. From an average distance of 142 million miles
        (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the
        Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the
        Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel
        from the Sun to Mars.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: chocolate">Orbit and Rotation</h2>
      <p>
        As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours,
        which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are
        called sols – short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols,
        which is the same as 687 Earth days. Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25
        degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This is
        another similarity
        <b style="color: brown"
          >with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars
          has distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth
          since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun (because it's farther away).
          And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year,
          lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary
          in length because of Mars' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the
          Sun. Spring in the northern h</b
        >emisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols.
        Autumn in the northern hemisphere (spring in the southern) is the
        shortest at 142 days. Northern winter/southern summer is 154 sols, and
        northern summer/southern winter is 178 sols.

        <em
          >Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured
          asteroids. They're potato-shaped because they have too little mass for
          gravity to make them spherical. The moons get their names from the
          horses that pulled the chariot of the Greek god of war, Ares.</em

          grooves on its surface. It is slowly moving towards Mars and will
          crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million years. Deimos
          is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two and a half times farther
          away from Mars. Oddly-shaped Deimos is covered in loose dirt that
          often fills the craters on its surface, making it appear smoother than
          pockmarked Phobos.</i

      <h2 style="color: brown">Surface</h2>
      <p>
        The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see colors
        such as brown, gold, and tan. The reason Mars looks reddish is due to
        oxidization – or rusting – of iron in the rocks, regolith (Martian
        “soil”), and dust of Mars. This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere
        and from a distance makes the planet appear mostly red. Interestingly,
        while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly
        the same area as Earth’s dry land. Its volcanoes, impact craters,
        crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have
        altered the landscape of Mars over many years, creating some of the
        solar system's most interesting topographical features. A large canyon
        system called Valles Marineris is long enough to stretch from California
        to New York – more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers). This Martian
        canyon is 200 miles (320 kilometers) at its widest and 4.3 miles (7
        kilometers) at its deepest. That's about 10 times the size of
        <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth/10-things-grand-canyons/"
          >Earth's Grand Canyon.</a
        >
        <i
          ><b>Mars </b>is home to the largest volcano in the solar system,
          Olympus Mons. It's three times taller than Earth's Mt. Everest with a
          base the size of the state of New Mexico. Mars appears to have had a
          watery past, with ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds,
          as well as rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have
          formed in liquid water. Some features suggest that Mars experienced
          huge floods about 3.5 billion years ago. There is water on Mars today,
          but the Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for
          long on the surface. Today, water on Mars is found in the form of
          water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions as well as in
          briny (salty) water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and
          crater walls.
        </i>
      </p>
      <h2 style="color: aqua">Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>
        Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen,
        and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of
        suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth. Mars'
        sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such
        objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets. The temperature on Mars
        can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low
        as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the
        atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. If
        you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it
        would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees
        Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees
        Celsius). Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust
        storms that cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be
        months before all of the dust settles.
