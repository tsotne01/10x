// Story:
// Youâ€™re a gatekeeper guarding a magical portal. The portal only opens if the user enters a number between 1 and 10. Use a do...while loop to keep asking until the user provides a valid input.
// Instructions:
// Write a function getValidInput() that repeatedly asks the user for a number between 1 and 10 using prompt(). The function should only stop when a valid input is given.
// Example:
// getValidInput(); // Keeps asking until a number between 1 and 10 is entered
