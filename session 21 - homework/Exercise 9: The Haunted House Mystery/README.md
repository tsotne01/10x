<h1>Story: A group of friends cautiously enters a small haunted house with just two rooms: the Kitchen and the Living Room. They want to quickly check if both rooms are clear of ghosts to know if the house is safe to proceed further.</h1>

Instructions:

* Declare boolean variables for two rooms:
* kitchenHasGhost - Set it to true if there's a ghost in the kitchen, or false if it's clear. Let's start by setting it to true for this example. (e.g., true)
* livingRoomHasGhost - Set it to true or false for the living room. Let's set it to false for this example. (e.g., false)

Determine if the house is safe:

* The house is considered safe only if both the kitchen AND the living room are clear of ghosts (meaning both kitchenHasGhost and livingRoomHasGhost are false).
* Use the logical AND operator (&&) to check if both kitchenHasGhost is false and livingRoomHasGhost is false.

Store the safety result in a variable:

* Store the result of your logical AND operation (which will be true or false) in a variable called isHouseSafe.

* Print a message indicating if the house is safe:
* Use an if/else statement based on the value of isHouseSafe:
* If isHouseSafe is true, print: "The house is safe! No ghosts in the Kitchen or Living Room."
* Else (if isHouseSafe is false), print: "Danger! The house is NOT safe. Ghosts detected!"
