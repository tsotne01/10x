<h1>Story: A music band needs to calculate their concert earnings and see if they made a profit after covering costs.</h1>

Instructions:

Declare variables:
ticketPrice set to 20.
ticketsSold set to 500.
concertCosts set to 8000.
Calculate the totalEarnings from ticket sales.
Calculate the profit (or loss) by subtracting concertCosts from totalEarnings.
Use an if/else statement to check if the band made a profit:
If profit is greater than 0, print a message like "Concert Profit: $2000. Great success!". (Use a template literal to include the calculated profit).
Otherwise (else), print a message indicating a loss or break-even, like "Concert did not cover costs. Earnings: $8000, Costs: $8000." (Use template literals to show earnings and costs).
