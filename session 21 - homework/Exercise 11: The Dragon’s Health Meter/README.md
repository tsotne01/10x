<h1>Story: A dragon is in a simple battle. A knight makes a single, basic attack, and we need to see how much health the dragon loses.</h1>

Instructions:

* Declare a variable for the dragon's starting health:
* dragonHealth - Set it to a starting number like 100.
* Declare a variable for the knight's attack damage:
* knightAttackDamage - Set it to a number representing the damage, like 25.
Reduce the dragon's health:
* Use the -= operator to subtract the knightAttackDamage from the dragonHealth. (e.g., dragonHealth -= knightAttackDamage;)
Print the dragon's remaining health:
* Use console.log() to display the dragonHealth after the attack. Label it clearly so it's easy to understand. For example: "Dragon's Health After Attack: [health value]". Use a template literal to include the dragonHealth in the message.
