<h1>Story: A classic showdown! Superhero "Valiant" and the notorious villain "Malakor" are testing their strength. We need to determine not just who is stronger, but by how much and announce the results with appropriate flair!</h1>

Instructions:

* Declare Variables for Strength Levels:

* heroStrength: Set to a number representing Valiant's strength (e.g., 95).
* villainStrength: Set to a number representing Malakor's strength (e.g., 90).
* Introduce Strength Difference Categories:

* We'll categorize the strength difference to provide more detailed outcomes:
* "Decisive Victory": If one character's strength is greater than the other by more than 10 points.
* "Close Call": If one character's strength is greater by 10 points or less.
* "Stalemate": If their strength levels are exactly equal.
* Compare Strength Levels and Determine the Outcome:
* Use if, else if, and else statements along with comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ===) to determine the outcome of the strength test based on the categories defined in step 2.
* Consider these comparisons:
* Is heroStrength greater than villainStrength by more than 10? (Decisive Hero Victory?)
* Is villainStrength greater than heroStrength by more than 10? (Decisive Villain Victory?)
* Is heroStrength exactly equal to villainStrength? (Stalemate?)
* If none of the above are decisively true, then it's a "Close Call". You'll need to figure out in the "else" or "else if" branches who is slightly stronger in a close call scenario.
* Print Descriptive Output Messages:
* Use console.log() and template literals to print messages that reflect the determined outcome with a bit of story-like flair. 
* For example:
* For a Decisive Hero Victory: "Valiant triumphs decisively! Malakor is utterly outmatched!"
* For a Decisive Villain Victory: "Malakor's power is overwhelming! Valiant is soundly defeated!"
* For a Stalemate: "It's a strength stalemate! Neither Valiant nor Malakor can overpower the other."
* For a Close Call Hero Victory: "Valiant barely edges out! A close call victory against Malakor!"
* For a Close Call Villain Victory: "Malakor narrowly prevails! A hard-fought win over Valiant!"
