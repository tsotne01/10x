// Story:
// Naruto is preparing for an intense battle, but he needs more shadow clones! The more chakra he uses, the more clones he creates. Can you write a function to calculate his clones?
// Instructions:
// Create an arrow function shadowClone(count) => count * 5.
// Call it with 10 (Output: "50 clones created!").


const shadowClone = (count) => console.log(`${count * 5} clones created !`);

shadowClone(5);
